# Contributing
Contributions are very welcome -- creating a demo notebook or some documentation is a great way to get started with Iodide!

You can get started by visiting https://iodide-project.github.io/master/ -- from there, you can begin working on a notebook, and export it to your local machine when you're happy with it.

When you have something you want to share, submit a PR to this repo. Before submitting a PR, please ensure that the resource links to the CSS and JS files in your exported notebooks use the URI `https://iodide-project.github.io/master/iodide.master.*`. (Note that if you started working from the link above, you shouldn't have to do anything.
